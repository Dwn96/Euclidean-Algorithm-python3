# Euclidean-Algorithm-python3
A short program that solves the euclidean algorithm. <br/>

Following program consist of functions for: <br/>
&nbsp; - [Euclid's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) and <br/>
&nbsp; - [Bézout's Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity). <br/>

Euclid's Algorithm is a nice and straight forward way <br/>
to find greatest common divider for two given numbers. <br/>
This is useful knowledge example in modular arithmetics, <br/>
algebra and number theory. <br/>
If greatest common divider of two given numbers is 1, <br/>
the numbers are called to be relative primes for eachother. <br/>

&nbsp; Say, if ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?gdc%28a%2Cb%29%3D1) for some numbers ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a) and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?b), <br/>
&nbsp; then ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ax%20&plus;%20bx%20%3D%201) for some values of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x) and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y). <br/>
&nbsp; Now we know couple of things. First of all <br/>
&nbsp; number ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ax) is said to be congruent with ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%20%5C%3A%20mod%20%5C%3A%20b) and <br/>
&nbsp; similiarily number ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?bx) is congruent with ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%20%5C%3A%20mod%20%5C%3A%20a) <br/>
&nbsp; in terms of [modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic). <br/>
&nbsp; This also means that if number ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a) belongs to a <br/>
&nbsp; algebraic structure called [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)) ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D_%7Bb%7D), <br/>
&nbsp; then ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a) has an inverse ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x) that also belongs to the <br/>
&nbsp; same ring, such that ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ax%3D1). <br/>
&nbsp; This is equivalent for number ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?b) an ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y) in a ring ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D_%7Ba%7D). <br/>
OBS! &nbsp; *Bézout's Identity* is defined first because it is called inside the *Euclid's Algorithm*. <br/>
