# Euclidean-Algorithm-python3
A short program that solves the euclidean algorithm. <br/>

Following program consist of functions for: <br/>
&nbsp; - Euclid's Algorithm and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm <br/>
&nbsp; - Bézout's Identity. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity <br/>

Euclid's Algorithm is a nice and straight forward way <br/>
to find greatest common divider for two given numbers. <br/>
This is useful knowledge example in modular arithmetics, <br/>
algebra and number theory. <br/>
If greatest common divider of two given numbers is 1, <br/>
the numbers are called to be relative primes for eachother. <br/>

&nbsp; Say, if "gdc( a, b ) = 1" for some numbers 'a' and 'b', <br/>
&nbsp; then "ax + bx = 1" for some values of 'x' and 'y'. <br/>
&nbsp; Now we know couple of things. First of all <br/>
&nbsp; number 'ax' is said to be congruent with 1 mod 'b' and <br/>
&nbsp; similiarily number 'bx' is congruent with 1 mod 'a' <br/>
&nbsp; in terms of modular arithmetic. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic <br/>
&nbsp; This also means that if number 'a' belongs to a <br/>
&nbsp; algebraic structure called ring Z_b, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) <br/>
&nbsp; then 'a' has an inverse 'x' that also belongs to the <br/>
&nbsp; same ring, such that "ax = 1". <br/>
&nbsp; This is equivalent for number 'b' an 'y' in a ring Z_a. <br/>
OBS! &nbsp; Bézout's Identity is defined first because it is called <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inside the Euclid's Algorithm. <br/>
